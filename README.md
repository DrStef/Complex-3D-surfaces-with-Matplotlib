# Testing_Matplotlib

Getting familiar with Matplotlib after using Matlab for over 20 years.
We test Matplotlib with complex 3D surfaces.

The initial motivation of this work was to develop advanced sensor array beamforming algorithms with Python. And develop complex Noise Reduction algorithms with Machine Learning or Deep Learning.
The design of optimal sensor arrays requires plotting 3D beampatterns for visualizing and testing the performance of beamforming algorithms. Animations are a plus.  
Then I wondered which Matplotlib modules could replace simple Matlab functions for plotting 3D implicit surfaces and polyhedrons.
